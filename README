Usage:
The Team Forming System consists of 3 screens. The Create Project
screen, the Assign Students to Teams screen, and the Add/Edit Student
Info screen.




=============================
= Step 0: Getting Acquanted =
=============================

When the program is first started, you are greeted in the very
bottom of the screen by the Status text area. Within this text
zone, important status information can be relayed to you instead
of through a plethora of popup and dialog boxes. This zone persists
throughout the execution of the program.


At the top of the program is the File menu. After a project has
been created, two new items appear under the new "Import" Menu Item.
From here you can import a CSV of Users and then you can import a
CSV of their skill Information.





==============================
= Step 1: Creating a Project =
==============================

This is the starting screen. You may optionally choose enter the
course number and project name for this project. If you are going to
manual rate skills for students, you must specify skills for this
project. Use the "Add skill" button to create a new skill for the
project. You can change the skill's name and weight by double clicking
on the values in the table to make them editable. The weight must be
an integer greater than or equal to 1. If you are planning to import
student ratings, there is no need to create skills on this screen.
When you are satisfied, click "Create project" to proceed to the next
screen.




=======================================
= Step 2: Assigning Students to Teams =
=======================================

To use this screen you must first create a list of students and rate
those students. Once you have a list of students and their ratings,
you may assign them to teams. After you have assigned students to
teams, you may view individual teams.

There are two ways to create a list of students: manually and by
importing CSV files. To import students manually, you simply click the
"Add" button at the bottom of the screen and fill in the Add/Edit
Student screen that appears. You may add as many students to a project
as you like. You may also edit or remove students by first selecting a
row in the table and clicking either the "Edit" or "Remove" buttons.

To import a list students from a CSV file, select "File > Import >
Students" from the program menu and choose a CSV file on your
computer. If it is in the proper format, the program will load all of
the students and you will seem them appear in the table. You can
follow a similar procedure to import ratings after you have imported
the students by selecting "File > Import > Ratings." We have included
some sample .csv files with the program source code for you to use or
inspect.

Once you have students and ratings entered, you can assign the
students to teams. First select a minimum team size from the "Team
size" drop down menu. All teams will be at least as many people on the
team as specified by team size, but teams will have not more than team
size + 1 people on each team. In other words, selecting a team size of
4 means there may be either 4 or 5 people on each team. Next you
select a team assignment method from the "Assignment method" drop down
menu to determine how teams are chosen. Finally, click the "Assign
Teams" button to assign students to teams. You may try different team
sizes and methods until you are happy with the chosen teams.

After the teams have been assigned you may select a particular team to
view from the "View team" drop down menu. When you select a team from
this menu, only students on that team will be shown in the table.




============================================
= Optional Step 3: Add/Edit Student screen =
============================================

This screen allows you to edit details about a student such as their
name, UTD email, and skill ratings.
